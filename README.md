# zellij-claude-teams

Use [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) **Agent Teams** inside [Zellij](https://zellij.dev) — no tmux required.

## The Problem

Claude Code's Agent Teams feature spawns each teammate in its own terminal pane using **tmux**. If you use Zellij as your terminal multiplexer, Agent Teams silently falls back to in-process mode — no split panes, no visual separation.

## The Solution

This project provides a **tmux shim** — a fake `tmux` binary that intercepts Claude Code's tmux commands and translates them to `zellij action` equivalents. Agent teammates spawn as real Zellij panes within your current tab.

```
┌──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐
│                      │  researcher          │
│   Claude Code        ├──────────────────────┤
│   (your session)     │  implementer         │
│                      ├──────────────────────┤
│                      │  tester              │
└──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘
```

Agent panes are named after their role and stack vertically on the right.

## Requirements

- **Zellij** 0.40+ (tested on 0.43.1)
- **Bash** 3.2+ (ships with macOS; Linux has 4+)
- **Claude Code** with Agent Teams support

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stanislc/zellij-claude-teams.git
cd zellij-claude-teams
bash install.sh
```

The install script copies files to `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/zellij-tmux-shim/` and prints the activation snippet for your shell.

### Shell activation

Add **one** of these to your shell config:

**Bash** (`~/.bashrc`):
```bash
if [ -n "$ZELLIJ" ]; then
    _shim="${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/zellij-tmux-shim/activate.sh"
    [ -f "$_shim" ] && . "$_shim"
    unset _shim
fi
```

**Zsh** (`~/.zshrc`):
```zsh
if [[ -n "$ZELLIJ" ]]; then
    _shim="${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/zellij-tmux-shim/activate.sh"
    [[ -f "$_shim" ]] && source "$_shim"
    unset _shim
fi
```

**Fish** (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`):
```fish
if set -q ZELLIJ
    set -l _shim (test -n "$XDG_DATA_HOME"; and echo "$XDG_DATA_HOME"; or echo "$HOME/.local/share")/zellij-tmux-shim/activate.fish
    test -f "$_shim"; and source "$_shim"
end
```

> Fish cannot source the bash `activate.sh`, so it uses the native
> `activate.fish` (installed alongside it). Deactivate with
> `source ~/.local/share/zellij-tmux-shim/deactivate.fish`.

Then restart your shell inside Zellij.

### Enable Agent Teams (required)

Agent Teams is **experimental and disabled by default** in Claude Code, and its
split-pane (tmux) mode is what this shim hooks into. Enable both in
`~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  },
  "teammateMode": "tmux"
}
```

- `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS: "1"` turns the feature on. Without it,
  Claude Code never spawns teammates and no panes appear.
- `teammateMode: "tmux"` forces split-pane mode. (`"auto"` also works because the
  shim sets `$TMUX`, but `"tmux"` is explicit.)

Requires Claude Code v2.1.32+. Restart `claude` after changing settings.

### Workspace trust (one-time)

Claude Code prompts for workspace trust per directory. To avoid each agent pane prompting individually, run `claude` once in your working directory and accept the trust dialog before using Agent Teams.

## Usage

Once activated, just use Claude Code normally inside Zellij:

```bash
claude           # start Claude Code
# Create a team → teammates appear as Zellij panes
```

The shim activates automatically when you're inside Zellij (it checks for the `$ZELLIJ` env var). Outside Zellij, it stays dormant.

### Deactivation

```bash
source ~/.local/share/zellij-tmux-shim/deactivate.sh
```

### Uninstall

```bash
cd zellij-claude-teams
bash install.sh --uninstall
# Then remove the activation snippet from your shell config
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ZELLIJ_TMUX_SHIM_DEBUG` | unset | Set to `1` to log all tmux calls to `$STATE_DIR/shim.log` |

## Features

- **Pane naming** — each agent pane is titled with its role (researcher, implementer, etc.) via `zellij action rename-pane`, which locks the title so Claude Code's TUI can't override it
- **Vertical layout** — the first agent splits right; subsequent agents stack below it automatically
- **Session isolation** — state is scoped by `ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME`, so multiple Zellij sessions don't collide
- **Tab isolation** — agent teams in different tabs within the same session are tracked independently via `.group` files
- **Focus management** — focus chains through agents during creation, with `move-focus right` ensuring correct placement even if you click back to main between spawns

## How It Works

The shim uses a **FIFO-per-pane** architecture:

```
Claude Code                    Shim (bin/tmux)                 Zellij
───────────                    ───────────────                 ──────
tmux split-window -h ───────→  alloc pane ID (%1)
                               snapshot parent env
                               zellij new-pane ──────────────→ creates pane
                               wait for .ready sentinel        ↓
                                                               wrapper starts
                                                               creates FIFO
                                                               touches .ready
                               ← returns %1

tmux send-keys -t %1 "cmd" ─→ write "cmd" to FIFO
                                                               wrapper reads FIFO
                                                               rename-pane (locks title)
                                                               touch .named sentinel
                               wait for .named
                                                               eval "$cmd"
                                                               (cmd runs in pane)

tmux kill-pane -t %1 ───────→ kill PID from .pid file
                                                               process exits
                                                               --close-on-exit
                                                               pane auto-closes
```

### Environment forwarding

Zellij's `new-pane` does **not** inherit the parent shell's environment (unlike tmux). The shim works around this by:

1. `snapshot_env()` captures the parent environment via `export -p` to a file
2. The pane wrapper restores it with `eval "$(cat parent.env)"`
3. Per-pane variables (`TMUX_PANE`, state dir) are overridden after restore

### Concurrency

- **Pane ID allocation** uses `mkdir`-based locking (portable; macOS lacks `flock`)
- Stale lock detection via PID-in-lockdir: if the locker process is dead, the lock is reclaimed
- Each pane's state is in separate files, so most operations are naturally isolated

## Troubleshooting

### Panes appear and disappear instantly

- **Stdout redirect**: The shim must never redirect the command's stdout. Claude Code checks `isatty(stdout)` and exits if it detects a pipe.
- **Workspace trust**: If you haven't accepted trust for the working directory, Claude Code exits immediately. Run `claude` once in that directory first.

### Agent panes steal focus

Focus chains through agents during creation for correct layout placement. After all agents spawn, click the main pane to return keyboard focus. If you're on an older version, update to the latest.

### Environment variables missing in panes

Ensure the shim is activated in your shell (check `echo $ZELLIJ_TMUX_SHIM_ACTIVE`). The shim snapshots your environment on first pane creation — variables set after activation but before the first `split-window` are captured.

### Debug logging

```bash
export ZELLIJ_TMUX_SHIM_DEBUG=1
# Use Claude Code normally, then inspect:
cat "${ZELLIJ_TMUX_SHIM_STATE}/shim.log"
```

## Known Limitations

- **No pane resizing** — Zellij manages layout automatically; tmux layout commands are no-ops
- **Fragile to Claude Code updates** — new tmux commands added upstream may need shim updates. Debug logging captures unhandled commands for diagnosis.
- **No Fish shell support** — Fish cannot source bash scripts. Use [bass](https://github.com/edc/bass) or contribute a `activate.fish`.

## Compatibility

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | Tested |
| macOS (Intel) | Should work |
| Linux (x86_64) | Should work (XDG-compliant paths, POSIX tools) |
| Linux (ARM) | Should work |
| WSL2 | Untested, likely works |

The shim avoids GNU-specific extensions:
- `export -p` instead of `env -0` for environment capture
- `mkdir`-based locking with PID stale detection instead of `flock` or `find -mmin`
- Fractional `sleep` with integer fallback
- Runtime state in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (Linux) or `$TMPDIR` (macOS)
